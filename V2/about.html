										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<p>I'm Marcel, a 28 year old IT Engineer in the Mission Critical field.</p>
									<p>My passion for technology started at a young age, I still remember opening up my first computer at 10 years old and the VCR wasnt safe either haha. Over the years, I've tried to expand my skills and developed an understanding of various IT things, including system administration, network management, and cloud computing.</p>
									<p>Professionally, I thrive in dynamic environments where I can apply my technical expertise to solve complex problems. And I enjoy collaborating with teams to design and implementing various IT solutions.</p>
									<p>When I'm not glued to my homelab, I enjoy spending time outdoors, exploring nature trails, or lose myself into Fantasy novels or random Manhwa's and ofcourse taking photographs of the beautiful landscapes I encounter while traveling.</p>
									<p>I would classify myself as a Jack of all trades. But I don't agree with the old saying "Jack of all trades, master of none." and rather say "Jack of all trades, master of none, though oftentimes better than a master of one." </p>
									<p>I also love to do the odd IT jobs around me like setting up the camera system of the restaurant at the Train station or even setup the POS system, Sound system, CCTV and networking at another local restaurant.</p>
